# II - Customer Journey

*‚ÄúBuilding a good customer experience does not happen by accident. It happens by design.‚Äù*

**Clare Muscutt**

## A - Definition

The user journey is a visual representation of the user's experience of a product, a service or even an ecosystem.

User journeys are visual representations of the steps that users take to achieve a specific outcome with your product or service. They can be simple or complex, depending on the scope and level of detail you want to capture. User journeys show the user's actions, thoughts, emotions, and touchpoints with your product or service, as well as the opportunities and challenges they face along the way.

## B - Why is it important ?

User journeys are important because they help you empathize with your users and see your product or service from their perspective. They also help you identify the gaps and problems in your current user experience, and generate ideas for solutions and improvements. User journeys can help you communicate your design vision and strategy to your stakeholders, team members, and clients, and demonstrate the value and impact of your UX work.

It is important to convey and view the customer journey as part of the work while designing your project or application. As it will help you study the problems within your application as to why some parts aren‚Äôt useful or aren‚Äôt as user logical as one thought.

# III - What is UX Design ?

¬†*‚ÄúUX‚Äù (User eXperience) and ‚ÄúDesign‚Äù.*

User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. UX design involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

The goal of UX Design is to convey an ideal customer journey thanks concepts and modelization. As a designer or as a developer, we will put ourselves in the shoes of the potential users and optimize all its perceptions of a solution we've created.

The term UX is often linked to digital environments (websites, mobile applications, etc.), but in reality, it applies to all the interactions a person can have during their day, from the products they use to the various services they can call upon.

When applied to a website, this translates into making the site accessible and easy to use, through its ergonomics, appearance and intuitive functionalities.
When we say that a site isn't intuitive, it's often because the UX has been poorly thought out or insufficiently developed.
We'll try to make it compatible with the different supports that already exist (Smartphone, Kiosk, PC), which is what we also call responsive.

# IV - What is UI Design ?

*User Interface Design*

User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms‚Äîe.g., voice-controlled interfaces.

According to Magnus Revang, the user experience can be classified into 6 main stages, corresponding to a multitude of parameters that the UI designer must take into account in his UX interface design process :

- **Visibility** : optimize referencing of the design project.
- **Accessibility** : a solution compatible with all existing media.
- **Attractiveness** : choose a design that is pleasant, useful, intuitive and practical.
- **Ease of use** : information is easy to find.
- **Credibility** : showcase the brand/company, convince users.
- **Efficiency** : users should find answers to their questions without difficulty.
